   <h2 style="margin-top:10ex">Introduction</h2>

   <p>
    For some time I've been the owner of the
    <a href="http://www.thrustmaster.com/en_UK/products/hotas-warthog"
     >Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS Flightstick and Throttle</a>.
    It's a great combo, but very soon it was evident that I
    should get some kind of mount to make full use of it.
   </p>

   <p>
    Searching through the internet I found that some use VESA brackets
    for mounting their HOTAS directly onto the chair. Given the weight
    and especially the size of the Warthog throttle I wasn't really
    sure whether this would work for the Thrustmasters. After digging
    a little bit deeper I found the
    <a href="https://www.monstertech.de/en/product-category/table-mounts/"
     >Monstertech Table Mounts</a> and took a closer look at these.
   </p>

   <h2 style="margin-top:10ex">The monetary side</h2>

   <p>
    Given the price tag I've been a little hesitant at first. The shop
    gives a price of 178.00 € for the silver Warthog flight stick and
    throttle mounts, as well as a whopping 218.00 € for the black ones.
    However, this is still without delivery costs and excluding (!)
    taxes. A EU customer who's being charged 19% VAT will therefore pay
    in the end about 222.65 € for the silver mounts and approximately
    270.25 € for the black ones, depending on shipping costs.
   </p>

   <p>
    Since the Warthog flight stick and throttle could be purchased on
    Amazon for a total of 333.78 €, making them just a little more expensive
    than the Monstertech mounts, I took some time to find possible
    alternatives, but decided in the end that I would give them a try.
   </p>

   <h2 style="margin-top:10ex">The package</h2>

   <p>
    Three weeks after placing my order, I unpackaged the following:
   </p>

    The mounting plates for the flight stick and the throttle.

      alt="Close-up showing adjustable mount and clamp.">
    </div>
    The position of the mounting point is adjustable. The mount itself
    is attached to the table with a clamp.
   </div>

   <h2>Assembling the mounts</h2>

   <p style="margin-top:5ex; margin-bottom:10ex">
    Using my own 5mm and 6mm hex keys and the little instruction manual
    which comes with the package, I was able to assemble the mounts in
    about one hour. While not too difficult, the weight of the items
    is noticeable. In the end, the assembled throttle and mount have a
    combined weight of more than 6kg.

   <h2>The Monstertech mounts in action</h2>

   <p style="margin-top:5ex; margin-bottom:10ex">
    For all the money you're surely getting really, really solid mounts.
    Once the screws are tight, I'd rather worry about the table than the
    mounts or the Thrustmasters.
